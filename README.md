# Color Match 
A relatively simple website that takes an input of RGB or Hex color codes, and finds the exact complementary color

---

Due to the fact that the website uses Flask, it cannot be hosted on a github pages site.

In order to run the site locally, please follow the steps below:
- Open the whole folder
- Go to the app.py file, and run `python -m flask run`
- Visit http://127.0.0.1:33705 in your browser

ALTERNATIVELY 

visit https://colormatch.emilybutera.hackclub.app/

And enjoy!
